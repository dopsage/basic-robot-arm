1. Description
It is what the name suggests - a really simple presentation of really basic robot arm.
The project features own animation system based on rotations along one axis (Z).
The presentation shows dedicated blender model being influenced by an animation system
in an infinite loop. User can control the camera view using WASD or arrow keys to
translate and mouse to rotate.

2. Motivation
Presenting good understanding of game development process and Unity game engine.
Featuring animation solutions that I myself find convienient and clean in use.
